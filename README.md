- 👋 Hi, I’m @basumaiku
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much coding as I can so I can, for both the sake of learning it as well as helping me flesh out ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I've done freelance web design, but want to learn how to broaden that to flesh out applications. I'm also intrested in learning Solidity and other languages involved in creating blockchain-based applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain-based applications. I have very little experience in it though, so I'd like to learn more first so I can feel confident in adding value.
- 📫 How to reach me - on here for now.
